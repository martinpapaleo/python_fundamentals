##Python Fundamentals – Stage 1

This repository contains the work I completed for Stage 1 of my Data Science learning roadmap.
It includes small Python scripts and mini-projects designed to practice core programming concepts before moving into data analysis with pandas.

The goal of this stage was to build a solid foundation in:

Python syntax

Functions and control flow

Data structures

File handling

Input validation

Small project design

Git & GitHub workflow

##How to Run

Clone or download the repository, then run any script with:

python script_name.py


Examples:

python loops_1_even_numbers.py
python word_counter.py
python budget_tracker.py


All scripts use only the Python standard library.

##Files Overview
#Loops

loops_1_even_numbers.py
Prints all even numbers from 1 to 50.

loops_2_guess.py
Simple number-guessing game with up to 3 attempts and input validation.

loops_3_nested.py
Displays a 10×10 multiplication table.

#Functions

functions_1_currency.py
Converts Argentine pesos (ARS) to USD at a given exchange rate.

functions_2_area.py
Computes the area of a circle.

functions_3_temperature.py
Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit with basic error handling.

#Data Structures

lists_1_basics.py
Creates and manipulates a list of cities; demonstrates slicing.

dicts_1_prices.py
Stores product prices in a dictionary and computes the average price.

sets_1_unique.py
Uses a set to extract unique elements from a list.

#File Handling & Modules

files_1_read.py
Writes a list of university careers to a text file and prints them in uppercase.

files_2_write.py
Asks the user for 5 movie names and writes them to 5_movies.txt.

modules_1_random.py
Reads movies from 5_movies.txt and prints one at random.

#Mini-Projects

word_counter.py
Takes a sentence and counts words, vowels, and consonants.

temperature_logger.py
Generates 10 days of random temperatures, saves them to temps.txt,
then reads the file to calculate average and maximum temperature.

budget_tracker.py
Interactive budget tracker:

Accepts categories and amounts from the user

Accumulates totals per category

Ends when the user types "quit"

Saves results to budget_tracker.csv

##What I Learned

Using Python for small, real programs

Designing reusable functions

Working with lists, dictionaries, sets

Validating user input and handling errors

Reading from and writing to files (TXT and CSV)

Using modules from the Python standard library

Structuring small projects

Basic Git workflow (init, add, commit, push)

Publishing work on GitHub in a clean, professional format

##Next Steps (Stage 2)

I will now begin pandas and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including:

Data cleaning (missing values, duplicates, datatypes)

joins/merges

Descriptive statistics

Visualizations with matplotlib and seaborn

First portfolio-quality notebook project

This next stage will have its own GitHub repository.
