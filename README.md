# Python Fundamentals – Step 1

Small Python scripts and mini-projects I wrote to practice the basics of programming and data handling.

This repository contains my work from **Stage 1** of my data science learning plan:
- Python syntax and control flow
- Functions
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets)
- Basic file I/O
- Simple mini-projects

## How to run

Clone or download the repository, then run any script with:

```bash
python script_name.py
