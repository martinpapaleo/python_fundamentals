# Python Fundamentals – Step 1

Small Python scripts and mini-projects I wrote to practice the basics of programming and data handling.

This repository contains my work from **Stage 1** of my data science learning plan:
- Python syntax and control flow
- Functions
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets)
- Basic file I/O
- Simple mini-projects

## How to run

Clone or download the repository, then run any script with:

```bash
python script_name.py

Examples:

python loops_1_even_numbers.py
python word_counter.py
python budget_tracker.py


All scripts use only the Python standard library.

Files overview
Loops

loops_1_even_numbers.py
Prints all even numbers from 1 to 50 (inclusive).

loops_2_guess.py
Simple number guessing game with up to 3 attempts.

loops_3_nested.py
Prints a 10×10 multiplication table (1 to 10).

Functions

functions_1_currency.py
Converts Argentine pesos to USD at a given exchange rate.

functions_2_area.py
Computes the area of a circle given its radius.

functions_3_temperature.py
Converts Celsius degrees to Fahrenheit with basic input validation.

Data structures

lists_1_basics.py
Creates and modifies a list of cities, then shows the first three.

dicts_1_prices.py
Stores product prices in a dictionary and computes the average price.

sets_1_unique.py
Shows how to use a set to get unique values from a list.

Files and modules

files_1_read.py
Writes a list of ITBA careers to a text file, then reads and prints them in uppercase.

files_2_write.py
Asks the user for 5 movie names and saves them to 5_movies.txt.

modules_1_random.py
Reads movies from 5_movies.txt and prints one at random.

Mini-projects

word_counter.py
Asks the user for a sentence and counts words, vowels and consonants.

temperature_logger.py
Generates random temperatures for 10 days, writes them to temps.txt, then reads them and prints the average and maximum temperature.

budget_tracker.py
Interactive budget tracker: asks for categories and amounts until the user types quit, accumulates totals per category, and saves the summary to budget_tracker.csv.

What I learned:

How to structure small Python programs using functions.

How to work with lists, dictionaries and sets.

How to read and write text files with with open(...).

How to do basic input validation and handle simple errors.

How to build small, self-contained scripts that can be reused later in bigger projects.


You can add/remove lines depending on which files you actually keep.
